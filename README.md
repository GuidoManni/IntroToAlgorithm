# Sorting Algorithms in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of various sorting algorithms as described in the book "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. The algorithms are implemented in a clear and concise manner, with detailed comments explaining the logic behind each step.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Insertion Sort** (Chapter 2, Algorithm 2.1, page 44)
2. **Merge Sort** (Chapter 2, Algorithm 2.3.1, page 64)

## Usage

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in its own Python file. The file contains a function that sorts a list of integers and a main block that generates a random list of integers, prints the unsorted list, sorts the list, and then prints the sorted list.

For example, to run the Insertion Sort algorithm, navigate to the directory containing `insertion_sort.py` and run the following command:

```bash
python3 insertion_sort.py
```

## Dependencies

The only dependency is Python 3. No additional libraries are required.
